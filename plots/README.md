# User Study Results
We used two objective metrics to analyze the outcomes of closing the loop on robot learning.

1. `Correct Prediction`: records how frequently users were able to correctly predict which chair leg the robot was assembling.

2. `Error`: the robot's errir in assembling the chair legs after receiving corrections from the human.
